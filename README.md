This is a tic-tac toe game built in Java with a twist. Rather than having the board traditionally implemented with a 2-dimensional array, a linked list with each node representing a board cell is used. To start the game loop,
simply run the Java file in the code editor of your choice. The program will display an empty board the prompt the first player to position their marker in a valid board cell. (From left to right) Top Row Positions: 
1,2,3; Middle Row Positions: 4,5,6; Bottom Row Positions: 7,8,9. For example, the middle left cell has a position of 4. Each player move will update the board and display it accordingly. First player to have marked 
three cells in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins! Otherwise, the board will fill up and result in a draw.
